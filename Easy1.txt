Q5.

The pizza name is an instance variable because of the @ symbol in front of the variable name.

Q6.

def volume
  @volume
end

Q7.

BasicObject has a to_s method which returns the object ID. You could just type object_name.to_s in IRB if you wanted to find out.

Q8.

'self' refers to an instance object being assigned. Because you are assigning a new value to the variable, Ruby can't tell if you're trying to make a new local variable or modify the existing instance variable. It will assume a new local variable unless you explicitly state self or @ infront of the instance variable name.

Q9.

This indicates a class method. This method is available to be called on the class object. For example 'Cat.cats_count' would return the class variable '@@cats_count' value. This method is not available to instances of the Cat class.
